# Airline Passenger Satisfaction Analysis

This project analyzes airline passenger satisfaction data, focusing on understanding how various factors (like flight distance, delays, and age group) influence customer satisfaction.

## Project Files

- `main.py`: Python script for data analysis and visualization.
- `test.csv`: Dataset containing airline passenger satisfaction data.
- `correlation_heatmap.png`: Heatmap showing correlations between numeric variables.
- `flight_distance_by_satisfaction.png`: Bar plot comparing satisfaction levels by flight distance.
- `arrival_delay_by_satisfaction.png`: Bar plot showing arrival delays by satisfaction level.
- `satisfaction_by_age_group.png`: Count plot showing satisfaction levels across age groups.

## Project Summary

In this project, we:
1. Cleaned and explored the dataset.
2. Conducted a correlation analysis to see relationships between numeric variables.
3. Visualized key factors affecting customer satisfaction, including:
   - Average flight distance by satisfaction level.
   - Arrival delay in minutes by satisfaction level.
   - Distribution of satisfaction across different age groups.

This analysis provides insights into areas that airlines can target to improve customer satisfaction.
